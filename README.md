# e-plantShopping

Paradise Nursery is a front-end shopping application that allows users to browse a selection of houseplants, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their cart before checkout. This project demonstrates core front-end development skills including component-based UI design, state management, navigation, and deployment using GitHub Pages.

## Project Overview

The Paradise Nursery app simulates an online plant store with the following goals:

Provide an engaging landing page introducing the company

Allow users to browse houseplants by category

Enable users to add, remove, and adjust items in a shopping cart

Display cart totals dynamically

Deploy the application as a publicly accessible website

This project builds on concepts and components from the practice project, with enhancements and additional functionality.
